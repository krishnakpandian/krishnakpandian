### Hi, Welcome to Krishna's Github ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**krishnakpandian/krishnakpandian** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
-->
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about systems design and software development
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any cool projects that are useful and fun to work on
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: krishnakpandian@gmail.com
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him/His
- âš¡ Fun fact: I set my git config with the wrong email ever since making a github and now my contributions are inaccurate. I don't plan on fixing it :/
